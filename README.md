## CAFAAssess
prediction files and ontology files should be preprocessed by preprocess.py

precRec.py is the main function to use
it depends on precrec/GOPred.py

All GO files, benchmark files and test prediction files are in /precrec/
Used GO release from 06/01/2014, otherwise would generate obsolete terms.
